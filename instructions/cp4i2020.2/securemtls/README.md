# Securing IBM MQ using mutual TLS
IBM MQ can be secured in a number of ways, two common approaches include:
* Username / Password
* Mutual TLS

This lab will demonstrate how you can use mutual TLS for authentication and authorization. 
The lab is dependant on a number of resources included within this GitHub repository. 

## Pre-reqs
To run the following you need to have installed:
* The MQ client or server as it uses GSKit and shipped MQ utilities
* OpenSSL to generate the raw certificates and keys

## Step 1 - Download this github repository

## Step 2 - Optionally re-generate the TLS Certificates and Keys

## Step 3 - Deploy the MQ Queue Manager with associated resources

## Step 4 - Test the deployment
